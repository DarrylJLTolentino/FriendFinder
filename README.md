## Description

This is a website that features a rudimentary friend finder that allows the user to find someone they are most compatible with based on a ten question survey. The website is based off of Heroku, which means that the user will run it off a port specified by the heroku app. When the user reaches the home page, the user can click on the API Friend List to show the friends array in JSON data format from friends.js. The user can also click on the Github Repository link to open a new tab to the repo page. The user can also click on the start the finder survey, which redirects to a new url that has the whole survey. Before the survey, the user has to give their name and a photo link or any text. The user then has to determine the best answers that describe themselves with a dropdown menu. The range is 1 to 5. After the user answers everything, the user can hit submit and a modal will pop up, showing the user who they are most compatible with out of some Fire Emblem characters within friends.js. After closing the modal, the user will be redirected back to the home page.

This webpage was supposed to be Fire Emblem themed, but the styling did not work out within the server and in the heroku app. It's something that I hope to fix at a later date.
